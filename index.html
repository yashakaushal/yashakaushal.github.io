								<b>Research Interests: </b> <br>
								I am interested in understanding the dynamics and cosmological evolution of high redshift massive galaxies.
								I have been using parametric SED fitting code Bagpipes (Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter Estimation)
								to determine the stellar population parameters like age, stellar mass, stellar metallicity and star formation histories in order to understand how
							        these properties have evolved with time.

								<b>Project-I <br>
								Understanding the Dynamics and Evolution of Galaxies in LEGA-C dataset  </b> <br>
								LEGA-C is a deep and rich dataset of ~3000 spectra of galaxies at half the age of the universe, each observed for ~20 hours
								giving continuum SNR of 20 per angstrom. With the help of bayesian statistical models, I am trying to fit these spectra to 
								reveal correlation between properties like stellar ages, stellar masses, metallicities as well as dynamical masses from stellar
								velocity dispersions.
